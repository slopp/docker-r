ShinyApps.io Testing
===========

**STOP** - This is _most likely_ not what you are looking for. This repository
supports a testing process outlined [here](https://github.com/rstudio/shinyapps-package-dependencies/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you are looking for Docker images with R, created by RStudio, search for
`rstudio/r-base` on DockerHub or visit https://github.com/rstudio/r-docker. We
apologize for the naming - this repository and set of images will be deprecated
in the future.
