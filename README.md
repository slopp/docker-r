shinyapps.io Testing
===========

**STOP** - This is _most likely_ not what you are looking for. This repository
supports a testing process outlined [here](https://github.com/rstudio/shinyapps-package-dependencies/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you are looking for Docker images with R, created by RStudio, visit [`r-base`
on DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/rstudio/r-base) or the [`r-docker` GitHub
repo](https://github.com/rstudio/r-docker). We apologize for the naming - this
repository and set of images will be deprecated in the future.
